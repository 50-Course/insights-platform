# Frontend

Suppose we do two screens,

- upload_screen.dart
- insights_screen.dart

We would keep data in a shared state management solution like Provider or Riverpod, and we would use a service to handle the API calls.

That would be in: api_service.dart

Structure:

lib/src/pages/
lib/src/services/api_service.dart
main.dart

# Backend
